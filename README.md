# WizProtect

WizProtect is a Python application for real-time object detection and protection using a webcam. It leverages the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) model and OpenCV to detect multiple objects, including nested objects, and highlights them with fixed color coding for clarity and consistency.

# Features
- Real-time Object Detection: Uses the YOLOv3 model for fast and accurate object detection directly from your webcam.
- Nested Object Detection: Capable of detecting and highlighting objects even if they are inside or overlapping with other objects.
- Fixed Color Coding: Each object class is highlighted with a consistent color, improving the visual clarity.
- Enhanced Visualization: Rounded corners for bounding boxes and labels with backgrounds make the UI more polished and user-friendly.
